# Hello World Node.js Server

This project is a simple Node.js server that uses the bare minimum to return a 200 OK status from the server. This should NOT be used as a boilerplate for starting a new API server; for boilerplate code visit [this page](www.srcmake.com/home/node-api).

## Running Locally

1. Have `node` and `npm` installed locally.
1. `npm install`
1. `node server.js`

Once running, you can go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to see the server sending a `status: OK` back to us.
